* Doesn't make sure to kill child if killed
* Now aware of ctx, would like to ad kubectx functionality to it
* Very little error checking
	* Fail with helpful error if SOCKs isn't connectable
* CI/CD improvement to cache
* Maybe create setting for making ssh connection if it's not listening already
* Should probably gather more faxts in "config", stuff like all paths for other configs
